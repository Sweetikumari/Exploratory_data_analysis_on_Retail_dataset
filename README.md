Objective of the Task:
Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’:

● Here, we will try to find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit.

● We will find out business problems that can be derived by exploring the data.

Conclusions of the Task:-

1. Top 4 profit giving states: 'California','New York','Washington' and 'Michigan'. We can increse sales in these states for increasing profit.

2. Top 4 loss giving states:'Illinois','Pennsylvania','Ohio' and 'Texas'. We have to pay attention to these states for reducing the loss and making these states on a positive cash flow.

3. Top 4 States with highest Sales : 'California','New York','Texas'and 'Washington' and Top 4 states with lowest Sales:'North Dakota','Maine','West Virginia'and'South Dakota'. We have to increase the sales of low sales states.

4. Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio have high Sales but negative Profit i.e. loss. This is becuse of the high discounts given to customer. We need to decrease discount percentage at Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.

5. Illinois has the highest Avg_discount_percent among the states of USA but profit and sales are low here. So we can reduce discount % in Illinois

6. Highest profits for each region are as follows:South= Consumer Segment, West= Corporate Segment,Central= Home Office Segment and East= Home Office Segment. We can increase the sales of respective highest profit making segments in the respective region.

7. Lowest profits for each region are as follows: South= Home Office Segment, West= Home Office Segment,Central= Consumer Segment and East= Corporate Segment. We have to focus on these states for increasing their profits.

8. Technology Category has the maximum Sales and Profit.This is because we have given lowest discounts for Technology category.Thus here we can say that If we give more Discount on products our sales goes increses but Profit get down.

9. Office Supplies category has minimum sales and Furniture category has lowest Profit. We have to focus on these categories.

10. Same Day Ship Mode has the highest sales and First Class Ship mode has the highest Profit and Discount. So, we have to use Same Day Ship Mode and First Class Ship in greater frequency.

11. Standard Class Ship mode has lowest sales and lowest profit. So, We can avoid this ship mode.

12. Among 'Sub- Category' items, Copiers has the highest profits in united States. Tables 'Sub- Category' is in loss. So, we have to focus on Tables 'Sub- Category'.

13. Among 'Sub- Category' items, Copiers and machines have the highest Sales in united States.Here we see that copiers had highest sale and Machines had second highest sales.In above two graph we see that 'Machines' had second highest sale but due to large discount it has less profit.

14. Low Sales 'Sub- Category' items: Fasteners, Labels, Paper, Art. We have to concentrate on these 'Sub- Category' items.
